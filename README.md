# fm-rock-paper-scissors (Rock Paper Scissors)

## General

My challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_
